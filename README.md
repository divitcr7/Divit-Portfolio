# Divit's Portfolio

Built with Next.js, CSS and the GitHub API. 

## About Me

I'm a software engineer with experience working at Amazon Logistics, Alleo AI, and other tech companies. I'm Currently studying @Rice

As a full-stack developer, I've built web applications using React, Node.js, MongoDB and other technologies. In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects.

## Portfolio Site

This portfolio site showcases my work as a software engineer. It was built using:

- **Next.js** - React framework for server-rendered React apps
- **CSS** - For styling and layout
- **GitHub API** - To display my latest repositories dynamically

The site contains sections for my background, projects, skills, and contact info. It is statically generated and optimized for SEO.

## Projects

The site displays my latest GitHub projects by calling the GitHub API. Some highlighted projects include:

- **My Cool App** - A full stack social app built with React, Node.js and MongoDB
- **Contributions** - Open source projects and contributions on GitHub
- **My Portfolio** - This portfolio site itself!

And more...

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install

```

This will start the development server on http://localhost:3000

## Deployment

The site is deployed on Vercel and configured to automatically deploy changes from GitHub.
